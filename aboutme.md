<p>Ave mundus (Latin for hello, world!), and thanks for stopping by! My name is Christopher Black – I’m a technology professional living in beautiful San Francisco (born and raised, thank you). I am a solutions architect at an amazing company called <a href="www.circleci.com">CircleCI</a>; we help teams of all shapes and sizes engineer better software, quicker, more reliably through a cutting edge continuous integration and deployment platform.

<p>I'm a proud UC Irvine Alumnus with a degree in Classical Civilization. Although I spent a few years as an undergrad studying dead languages and the Greeks, I found myself thrown into the engine room doing DevOps and site reliability engineering professionally when I graduated college in 2014. It’s a long story as you can imagine…but I’ve always had an insatiable curiosity when it came to computers and technology. I have a wide range of interests and intellectual pursuits, from ancient history to software and technology; from political theory and the writings of Rousseau to Nas and the masterpiece that is Illmatic.</p>

<p>I’m currently working as a solutions architect - essentially the intersection of engineering and sales. It is a perilous yet immensely rewarding client facing role that offers the chance to work with really talented people while solving complex problems every day. Working in the CI/CD space is a uniquely challenging opportunity because I’m exposed to so many different technologies and problem sets; from continuous deployment in the context of mobile application development to managing complex systems using infrastructure as code.

<p>I volunteer extensively with Larkin Street Youth Services, teaching homeless and at-risk youth computer science, programming, and career readiness. It's easily the most rewarding thing I do. It’s my own little way of trying to make an impact and giving back to an organization that did a lot for me during a really dark chapter in my life…but that is a different story for another time.</p>

<p>Toastmasters is another big part of my life. Public speaking is a wonderful skill, irrespective of profession or background; everyone can benefit tremendously from improving their public speaking skills. I’ve been a proud member of Golden Gate Toastmasters for several years now. It’s a great club with a wonderful, supporting group of talented professionals. I highly encourage everyone to come check out a meeting.</p>

<p>This forum will be used to write about my passion for software, technology, and DevOps, with the occasional musing on the ancient world, my journey as an SE/SA in Silicon Valley, and other (hopefully interesting) topics that come to mind. I'll occasionally write about the lost art of public speaking as well. And I’ll also touch on the work I do with Larkin Street Youth Services, the incredible impact they're making and most importantly, how you can get involved.</p>

<p>If you enjoy software and technology, history and philosophy, don’t take yourself too seriously and enjoy good hip-hop over non-hipster coffee, you’ve come to the right little corner of the internet.</p>
