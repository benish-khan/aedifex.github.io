# Animate-Your-Name

Everything needed to animate your name in Javascript is included in the repo.

## Getting Started

Simply create a new folder and `git clone git@github.com:aedifex/Animate-Your-Name.git`

Open `index.html` in a browser and voila.

Assuming you **don't** want to see *my* name animated, open `main.js` and change the variable `myName` to equal your name...Or something clever, like a <3 next to your favorite person.
